I want to create a new blog post about mathematics. I am also a programmer, so i want to do a lot of animations. Provide me such ideas for a post and the animations i can do to support my post. List me 3 ideas in the following format.
I want the topics to be advanced and involve a lot of maths in them.

[
  {
    'name': <name of idea>,
     'description': "<idea>"
  },
  ...
]

Make the <name of idea> be only one word or two words long.
